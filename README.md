# Photo-Assistant
Photo Assistant is a photography helper mobile application that levels up the shooting experience for photographers at any level.
It helps users to automatically calculate exposure and depth-of-field values, and provides real-time weather updates (including temperature, UV index), and sunrise and sunset times.

### Product Functions
Check the weather (current temperature, humidity, PSI, and the forecast for the next 9-12 hours.)  

Check the horizon, civil, nautical and astronomical sunrise and sunset timings.  

Choose up to 4 camera bodies with 5 lenses each as presets.  

Use the phoneâ€™s processor and camera as an exposure, field of view and depth of field calculator, with optional preset modes.  

### Limitations
Since our app uses the Singaporean government weather API, the weather function is restricted to Singapore only.  

#### Note:
This app was a course project for CZ2006 Software Engineering at NTU, AY2019 Fall semester.
